# LMU-Senior-Project-2-ASL2Eng

This repo will serve as the home for my 2nd Senior Capstone Project.

There are 2 classifiers for this project:

1. A Finger-Spelling ASL Classifier
2. A Word Level ASL Classifier

The 1st was a collaborative effort with 2 other students and is usable.
The 2nd is an individual effort, but not in a usable state yet.
